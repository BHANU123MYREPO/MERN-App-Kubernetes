**Running backend part first :** 

**API Endpoints**: Frontend applications usually interact with backend services via APIs. Therefore, the backend APIs need to be available and operational before the frontend can make requests to them.

**Service Availability**: Backend services might have dependencies on databases, external services, or other resources. By starting the backend first, you ensure that these dependencies are available and initialized before the frontend starts consuming the services.

**Here in this case we are using the MongoDB Atlas Database :** 

1) **Cost**: While MongoDB Atlas offers a free tier with limited features, scaling up or using advanced features may incur costs. Depending on your usage and requirements, the cost of using MongoDB Atlas could be higher compared to hosting your own database infrastructure.

2) **Dependence on Internet Connection**: Since MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based service, your application's performance and availability may be affected by the stability and speed of your internet connection. Any disruptions in internet connectivity could impact your ability to access or modify data stored in MongoDB Atlas.

3) **Data Security and Privacy**: Storing sensitive data on a third-party platform like MongoDB Atlas raises concerns about data security and privacy. While MongoDB Atlas implements security features such as encryption and access controls, there may still be risks associated with storing confidential information on an external platform.

4) **Vendor Lock-in**: Using MongoDB Atlas ties you to the MongoDB ecosystem and infrastructure. Switching to a different database provider or migrating your data out of MongoDB Atlas may be complex and time-consuming, leading to vendor lock-in.

5) **Limited Control**: With MongoDB Atlas, you have less control over the underlying infrastructure compared to hosting your own database servers. This may limit your ability to customize configurations or troubleshoot issues that arise at the infrastructure level.

6) **Compliance and Regulatory Concerns**: Depending on your industry and location, you may be subject to specific compliance requirements and regulations regarding data storage and processing. You'll need to ensure that MongoDB Atlas complies with relevant regulations and meets your organization's compliance needs.

7) **Performance and Latency**: While MongoDB Atlas offers global clusters for distributing data across multiple regions, latency may still be a concern, especially if your application users are located far from the nearest MongoDB Atlas data center. Ensuring acceptable performance and minimizing latency may require additional optimization efforts.
